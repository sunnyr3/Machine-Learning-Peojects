# Machine-Learning-Peojects

## Introduction
I started studying ML in late May 2018. I took a free online course series by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) and some other online tutorials. 

## TitanicL Machine Learning from Disaster
This a basic-leveled ML project from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). In this project, I've completed the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive, and I've aldo applied the tools of ML to predict which passengers survived with **86.87% accuracy**. (Still need improvement...)
