# Machine-Learning-Peojects

## Introduction
I started studying ML in late May 2018. I took a free online course series by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) and some other online tutorials. 

### Early Projects
This folder contains several simple projects in which I practiced the following ML algorithms:
* Decision Trees and Random Forest
* K Means Clustering 
* K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
* Natural Language Processing
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
