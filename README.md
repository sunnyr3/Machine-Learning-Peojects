# Machine-Learning-Peojects

## Introduction
I started studying ML in late May 2018. I took a free online course series by [Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning/home/welcome) and some other online tutorials. 

### Early Projects
This folder contains several simple projects in which I practiced the following ML algorithms:
* [Decision Trees and Random Forest](https://github.com/sunnysakura13/Machine-Learning-Peojects/blob/master/Early%20Projects/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project/Decision%20Trees%20and%20Random%20Forest%20Project%20.ipynb)
* [K Means Clustering](https://github.com/sunnysakura13/Machine-Learning-Peojects/blob/master/Early%20Projects/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project/K%20Means%20Clustering%20Project%20.ipynb)
* [K Nearest Neighbors (KNN)](https://github.com/sunnysakura13/Machine-Learning-Peojects/blob/master/Early%20Projects/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project/K%20Nearest%20Neighbors%20Project.ipynb)
* [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/sunnysakura13/Machine-Learning-Peojects/blob/master/Early%20Projects/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20Project/NLP%20Project.ipynb)
* [Support Vector Machines (SVM)](https://github.com/sunnysakura13/Machine-Learning-Peojects/blob/master/Early%20Projects/Support%20Vector%20Machines%20Project.ipynb)
